### SEGMENTATION: 
Using CLV scores, customers were segmented into:
- High-Value Customers: Long tenure, high spending.
- Moderate-Value Customers: Medium tenure, moderate spending.
- Churn Risk Customers: Short tenure, irregular spending patterns.

## MARKETING STRATEGIES: 
### CROSS-SELLING AND UP-SELLING:
Employed techniques to maximize sales revenue and improve customer satisfaction by providing more comprehensive solutions or experiences.
#### Cross-Selling Strategies
- Offering tech support to senior citizens without dependents leads to higher satisfaction, increased loyalty, reduced frustration, and enhanced brand image, ultimately resulting in lower churn rates and potential for additional revenue through cross-selling.
  
üìå Target Group: Senior Citizens (No dependents, churn risk).

üìå Offer: Tech Support package.

- Multiple lines for dependents and partners on basic plan
  
#### Up-Selling Strategies
- Offering higher-paying customers cheaper plans with lock-in periods can increase customer retention and lifetime value by reducing churn. This also creates custome loyalty to the brand, not just due to the lock in but because customers appreciate discounts, especially when it appears like the brand is looking out for them.
